## Title: HTML Run

**Target Platform:** The game is designed to be played on a desktop / computer where users have access to a keyboard to control the movements of the player. However the game can be played on mobile devices (max 2 players) but it is not recommended as most mobile device browsers don't allow multiple touch interactions causing a bad user experience in web games.

**Game Genre:** This game is similar to a 2D endless runner where the players must dodge obstacles and survive until they are the only one alive.

**Game Objective:** The objective of the player in this game is to survive as long as possible by using powerups and dodging the obstacles until they are the last one standing. If a player is playing alone, the player can play as long as they survive while the game will keep getting faster and harder.

  

**Rules of the Game:**
 1. Each player must dodge the obstacles that come towards them
 2. Each player can collide with power ups and collect them to use them
    later on
	 * Shield power up will allow the user to take a hit from any 1
    obstacle
	 * Spring boots power up will allow the user to jump twice the height
    once
3. To make it fair, each player starts off in the exact same position



**Game Mechanics:**
1. Players can be added to the game by clicking "Add Player" button
   * User will be given the option to choose input buttons for Jump and Power key
   * Those keys cannot be same as another previously added players
2. The obstacles will spawn gradually and will become more frequent the more the game goes on
3. Sometimes it may be impossible to dodge all the obstacles, at that point players will need to time their jump or use their power-ups to survive longer than the other players
