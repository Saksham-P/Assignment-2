                <ul>
                    <li>This game is designed for desktop but is mobile-ready.
                        <br>The minimum play-able witdth for the game is around 700px (landscape), 
                        <br>below that it becomes hard for 2 players to use the same device.    
                    </li>
                    <li>HTML Run is almost like a 2D endless Runner, where each
                        <br>player must keep going until they are last one standing
                    </li>
                    <li>The Objective of this game is for each player to survive
                        <br>for as long as possible and dodging all obstacles
                        <br>until 1 player remains
                    </li>
                    <li>There are 2 power ups players can get within the game
                        <br>A sheild which protects player from getting hit by 1 obstacle and
                        <br>Spring Boots, which makes the player jump high once.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each player will have 2 controls, and each player will be able
                        <br>to choose which button to use for each action.
                        <br>Players will have a jump button, and a power button.
                        <br>Jump button makes the player jump, and power button uses 
                        <br>the powerup the player has.
                    </li>
                    <li>To add players (desktop version only), players will need to
                        <br>click "Add Player" button on the main page, which will prompt
                        <br>the user to set buttons for jump and power for that player.
                        <br>Maximum of 5 players can be added.
