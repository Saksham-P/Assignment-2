# Reflection - SENG513 A3 (Saksham Puri 30140617)
## What I Learned
- Overall, during the development of this website I learned to use units such as svh/w dvh/w to dynamically correct for android device's browser heights
- Better understanding of how arrays work in javaScript and how to use them to store DOM elements
- Multiple JavaScript functions to find and access DOM nodes to change HTML Elements
## Some Challenges I Faced were:
- Adding DOM elements at appropriate places, since having a lot of elements on screen  makes it a bit complex to choose where to dynamically place DOM elements
- Timing everything correctly including the animations so they seamlessly loop (this still doesn't work for all screen sizes)
- Changing Game animation speed relative to how long the game has been going on for, this was a challenge as finding the perfect balance between too easy and too hard was a bit complex with multiple variables
## How was the Game Complexity Managed
- The Game Speed is gradually increased periodically which makes the player make fast decisions with the uncertainty of not knowing what obstacle comes next
- Power ups are something that help players get score and help them get out of tough situations
## What are the Key Differences in Final Product and Initial Design
- The Final Game Product doesn't include one initial design of having an end point in the game, at first the plan was to end the game if it got too fast, but now its endless
- One big element that didn't make it to the Final Product was having a big HTML Image chase after the players to give a reason to the game, but that wouldn't work with all screen sizes and was scraped
## Why didn't I use A.I
- I Felt that using AI such as ChatGPT wouldn't help me find and learn new concepts in manipulating DOM elements
- Using code generated by AI would make me unfamiliar with it and since many components of code are interonnected with each other, it would become hard to follow up on other ideas without using AI further
- I initially just didn't think that it was necessary to use AI for this assignment and it didn't cross my mind
